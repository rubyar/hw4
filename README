This archive contians three separate git repositories, one for each question.

This folder itself is not a git repository.

To get started, try
  cd 1
  git log

For number 1, the most recent commit is the one that made the mistake. Try

  git log -n1 --name-status
  |   |   |   |
  |   |   |   \- Add the names and "status" (A-Added, D-Deleted, M-modified)
  |   |   |      for each file affected by this commit.
  |   |   |      Also consider trying --stat for more details
  |   |   |
  |   |   \- Show only the most recent (one) commit.
  |   |
  |   \- Choose the `log` subcommand. This command is used for exploring
  |      committed history, which makes it a good command for part 1, which
  |      explores committed history. It's less useful for part 2 or part 3...

  \- git is the program you are running. "git" itself does nothing, rather you
     need to tell git what operation you would like it to do, such as "init" to
     create a new repository or "commit" to save staged changes.

     This is a common pattern for many utilites, such as "apt-get" which you
     have used to "apt-get install" programs, but can also "upgrade" them,
     "remove" them, or "apt-get source" to download their source code.
